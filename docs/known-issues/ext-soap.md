## Duplicate typenames

When there are 2 types with the same name in different XML namespaces,
ext-soap is not able to link those types to 2 different PHP objects.
This package will generate the code for the last detected type in the WSDL.

Suggested workaround:

1. Use one of [the built-in duplicate types strategies](../drivers/metadata.md#duplicate-types)
2. Manually determine type converters for the various classes:
    - Manually create the missing classes.
    - Determine which is the most important type and use that one in the classmap.
    - You can use the type converters for the other type(s) with the same name.
    - You'll need to manually parse the XML and link it to an object.

```php
$soapOptions = [
    'classmap' => [
        'Store' => MostImportantStore::class,
    ],
    'typemap' => [
        [
            'type_name' => 'Store',
            'type_ns' => 'http://......lessimportantstore',
            'from_xml' => function($xml) {
                $data = simplexml_load_string($xml);
    
                return LessImportantStore::fromXml($data);
            },
        ],
    ],
];
```

Alternative workaround:

- Merge all properties of all types in one big class.
- Map the master class to the xsd type in the classmap
- This might be a bad idea of the objects are not very similar.

## Enumerations

It is possible that the WSDL file contains `xsd:enumeration` elements.
Since PHP does not have an internal `enum` type,
ext-soap will transform the data to the type that is determined in the `xsd:restriction` section.
The soap client will never try to validate the input against the configured enumerations inside the WSDL.

For example:
```xml
<xsd:simpleType name="PhoneTypeEnum">
    <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string">
        <xsd:enumeration value="Home"/>
        <xsd:enumeration value="Office"/>
        <xsd:enumeration value="Gsm"/>
    </xsd:restriction>
</xsd:simpleType>
``` 

- It is perfectly possible to pass a value of "InvalidData" to the server through the soap-client.
- Internally, ext-soap will typehint this enum as a string so there is no complex type available.
- You won't be able to access the available options without manually parsing the WSDL file.
- If you do want to use a custom class for the enumerations type, you can create a type converter like this:

```php
$soapOptions = [
    'typemap' => [
        [
            'type_name' => 'PhoneTypeEnum',
            'type_ns' => 'http://soapinterop.org/xsd',
            'from_xml' => function($xml) {
                $doc = new \DOMDocument();
                $doc->loadXML($xml);

                return new PhoneTypeEnum($doc->textContent);
            },
            'to_xml' => function(PhoneTypeEnum $enum) {
                return sprintf('<PhoneTypeEnum>%s</PhoneTypeEnum>', $enum->getValue());
            },
        ],
    ],
];
```

## Occurs

It is possible that the WSDL file contains `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` on XSD elements.
Ext-soap will not make this information available through the public API of the SOAP client.
Therefore, we cannot predict during code generation if a type will definitely be an array or possibly be nullable.

Currently, this issue can be avoided by not generating too strict types in the soap-client and optionally by using the [IteratorAssembler](../code-generation/assemblers.md#iteratorassembler).
A better solution would be to parse the WSDL manually and add that information to the metadata.
From that point on we can take this information into consideration during code generation.
